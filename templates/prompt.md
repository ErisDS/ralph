# Project Instructions

Add project-specific instructions that Ralph should follow when working in this codebase.

This file is appended to the main prompt (Docker mode only). Use it for:
- Preferred commands to run (e.g., `pnpm check` instead of separate lint/test/build)
- Required files to update (e.g., changelog, version files)
- Naming conventions or architectural constraints
- Project-specific testing or verification steps

Keep it concise - the main implementation guidance is in the shared template.
